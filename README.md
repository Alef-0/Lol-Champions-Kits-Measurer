# Lol-Champions-Kits-Measurer
Way to measure the size of the kits from the characters of the game LOL using the wiki as a base.
The file "size_of_kit.txt" contains the amount of champions, their name, and the length in characters of their kits.
The file "ordered_kit_size.txt" contains the size of the kit in ascending order, and also the size in relation with the smallest champion size.
